Introduction

The Latin Squares Puzzle is an N*N array filled with numbers and blank squares. In this puzzle, the players are asked to shade in some of the squares but within the rules of the puzzle. There are four restrictions for this problem. Firstly, no shaded squares is adjacent (including diagonally) to another square. Secondly, there is exactly one shaded squares in each row and each column. Additionally, no shaded square containing a number can be shaded. Last but not least, each number should be equal to the number of adjacent (including diagonally) shaded squares. It is worth noting that the unique solution can be found in every puzzle. That is to say, every limiting condition can narrow down the scope of the answer and the unique one will be picked finally.
